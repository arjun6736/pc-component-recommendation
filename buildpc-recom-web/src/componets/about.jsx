              Building a custom PC can be complex, especially for users
              unfamiliar with hardware compatibility and performance factors.
              Our PC Configuration & Recommendation System simplifies this
              process by providing personalized PC build suggestions based on
              user preferences, budget, and real-world component reviews.

              Through an interactive Q&A system, users define their needs, and
              our smart engine filters compatible components, ensuring an
              optimized and functional build. Additionally, we integrate
              sentiment analysis from Reddit to recommend the best-reviewed
              components, helping users make informed decisions.
